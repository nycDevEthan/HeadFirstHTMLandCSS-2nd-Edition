        <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
            through some interesting places on the way:
        </p>
        <ol> <!--ordered list-->
            <li>Walla Walla, WA</li> <!--list item-->
            <li>Magic City, ID</li>
            <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
            <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
            <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
            <li>Why, AZ</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side
            of the road today: 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
                Passing cars, <br> <!--line break also a "void element"-->
                When you can't see, <br>
                May get you, <br>
                A glimpse, <br>
                Of eternity. <br>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            I definitely won't be passing any cars.

        <p>My first day of the trip!  I can't believe
            finally got everything packed and ready to go.
            Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring
            a whole lot with me:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Charge Segway</li>
            <li>Pack for trip
                <ul> <!--unordered list-->
                    <li>cell phone</li>
                    <li>iPod</li>
                    <li>digital camera</li>
                    <li>a protein bar</li> 
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Call mom</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a
            thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
